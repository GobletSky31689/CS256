In this trial, we trained on 10000 images, and tested on 20000 images.
Training was done on letter 'C'.
Both the training and testing data set had 50-60% images of letter C.
Seven experiments were conducted:
1) No regularisation
2) L1 with alpha 0.01
3) L2 with alpha 0.01
4) L1 with alpha 0.5
5) L2 with alpha 0.5
6) L1 with alpha 1.0
7) L2 with alpha 1.0
